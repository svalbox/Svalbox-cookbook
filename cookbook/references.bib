  abstract = {Abstract The renowned Festningen section in the outer part of Isfjorden, western Spitsbergen, offers a c. 7 km-long nearly continuous stratigraphic section of Lower Carboniferous to Cenozoic strata, spanning nearly 300 million years of geological history. Tectonic deformation associated with the Paleogene West-Spitsbergen-Fold-and-Thrust belt tilted the strata to near-vertical, allowing easy access to the section along the shoreline. The Festningen section is a regionally important stratigraphic reference profile, and thus a key locality for any geologist visiting Svalbard. The lithology variations, dinosaur footprints, and the many fossil groups, record more than 300 million years of continental drift, climate change, and sea level variations. In addition, the Festningen section is the only natural geoscientific monument protected by law (i.e. geotope) in Svalbard. In this contribution, we present a digital outcrop model (DOM) of the Festningen section processed from 3762 drone photographs. The resulting high-resolution model offers detail down to 7.01 mm, covers an area of 0.8 km2 and can be freely accessed via the Svalbox database. Through Svalbox, we also put the Festningen model in a regional geological context by comparing it to nearby offshore seismic, exploration boreholes penetrating the same stratigraphy and publications on the deep-time paleoclimate trends recorded at Festningen.},
